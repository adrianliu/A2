In this project,
1. I did not use Blueprint because there are not many modules.
2. I disabled base.py file, I put all of the models and schemas in __init__.py, the reason is that I keep getting circular dependency error when using base.py.
3. I used marshmallow, SQLAlchemy.
4. All test cases passed, please feel free to email me if there is any issue. Thanks!
